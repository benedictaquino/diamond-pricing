# Diamond Pricing Model

For my Linear Models course at Holy Cross my final project was a diamond pricing
model created using multivariate linear regression techniques on a data set of 
308 diamonds. The analysis was done using R. 

After completing Galvanize's Data Science Immersive program I wanted to revisit
this project using Python. Also, R's tidyverse package has a built in dataset
of diamonds with some similar features. I wanted to train the model on this 
larger dataset of ~54,000 diamonds and see how it performs on the 308 diamonds,
as well as see how the model trained on the 308 diamonds I created for my course
project performs on the larger set. The features are slightly different, but my 
models only used the common features.
