# Diamond Pricing Model

For my Linear Models course at Holy Cross my final project was a pricing model
created using multivariate linear regression techniques. The original data used
was a subset that only contained data on 308 diamonds and the analysis was
done in R. After completing the Data Science Immersive course at Galvanize, I 
want to revisit this project and use the larger data set of 53,940 diamonds
that comes with the R tidyverse package.
